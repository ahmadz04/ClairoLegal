      "clause": "Copyright © 2020 NonDisclosureAgreement.com. All Rights Reserved. Page 1 of 2 NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (NDA) This Nondisclosure Agreement or (\"Agreement\") has been entered into on the date of ______________________________ and is by and between: Party Disclosing Information: ______________________________ with a mailing address of ____________________________________________________________ (“Disclosing Party”). Party Receiving Information: ______________________________ with a mailing address of ____________________________________________________________ (“Receiving Party”).",
      "summary": "This clause introduces a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) that is a legal contract between two parties: one that shares confidential information (the \"Disclosing Party\") and one that receives it (the \"Receiving Party\"). The agreement outlines the responsibilities of both parties to keep the shared information private and not disclose it to others. Essentially, it protects sensitive information from being leaked or misused.",
      "is_risky": true,
      "risk_reason": "The clause contains vague and ambiguous language, particularly in the definition of the parties involved. The placeholders for the names and addresses of the Disclosing Party and Receiving Party leave the agreement incomplete and open to interpretation. Additionally, the clause does not specify the scope of the information to be protected, which could lead to overly broad interpretations of what constitutes confidential information. This lack of specificity can create risks for the Receiving Party, as they may inadvertently breach the agreement by disclosing information that the Disclosing Party considers confidential but is not clearly defined in the contract. Furthermore, the clause does not outline the obligations of the Receiving Party in detail, which could lead to one-sided obligations favoring the Disclosing Party without adequate protections for the Receiving Party.",
      "suggestion": "**Negotiation Suggestion:**\n\nTo address the risks identified in the NDA clause, propose the following specific changes and additions to ensure clarity and protect the interests of the Receiving Party:\n\n1. **Define the Parties Clearly:**\n   Replace the placeholders with specific language that requires the parties to fill in their names and addresses before signing. For example:\n   - \"This Non-Disclosure Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is entered into as of [insert date] by and between [Full Legal Name of Disclosing Party], located at [Full Address of Disclosing Party] (the “Disclosing Party”), and [Full Legal Name of Receiving Party], located at [Full Address of Receiving Party] (the “Receiving Party”).\"\n\n2. **Specify the Scope of Confidential Information:**\n   Add a clear definition of what constitutes \"Confidential Information\" to avoid ambiguity. For example:\n   - \"For purposes of this Agreement, 'Confidential Information' shall include any data or information that is proprietary to the Disclosing Party and not generally known to the public, including but not limited to business plans, financial information, customer lists, technical data, and any other information that is marked or identified as confidential at the time of disclosure.\"\n\n3. **Outline Obligations of the Receiving Party:**\n   Include a section that clearly outlines the obligations of the Receiving Party regarding the handling of Confidential Information. For example:\n   - \"The Receiving Party agrees to: (i) maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information with the same degree of care as it uses to protect its own confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable care; (ii) not disclose any Confidential Information to any third parties without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party; and (iii) use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of [insert specific purpose, e.g., evaluating a potential business relationship].\"\n\n4. **Add a Termination Clause:**\n   Include a clause that specifies the duration of the confidentiality obligations. For example:\n   - \"The obligations of confidentiality shall remain in effect for a period of [insert duration, e.g., two years] from the date of disclosure of the Confidential Information.\"\n\nBy implementing these changes, you will create a more balanced NDA that protects the interests of the Receiving Party while still meeting the needs of the Disclosing Party. These suggestions are reasonable and likely to be accepted, as they enhance clarity and mutual understanding in the agreement."

      "summary": "This clause establishes that both parties will keep certain sensitive information private to prevent it from being shared without permission. \"Confidential Information\" refers to any valuable business information that the party sharing it wants to protect. Essentially, both sides agree to respect each other's secrets and not disclose them to outsiders.",

      "risk_reason": "The clause contains vague and overly broad terms, particularly in the definition of 'Confidential Information.' The phrase 'all information or material that has or could have commercial value or other utility' is ambiguous and could encompass a wide range of information, potentially including data that is not truly confidential or proprietary. This could lead to disputes over what constitutes confidential information and may impose unreasonable restrictions on the receiving party. Additionally, the clause does not specify the duration of confidentiality obligations or the consequences of unauthorized disclosure, which are important protections that are missing.",
      "suggestion": "**Negotiation Suggestion:**\n\nTo address the vagueness and potential overreach of the current definition of \"Confidential Information,\" propose the following concrete language changes and additions:\n\n1. **Refine the Definition of Confidential Information:**\n   - Replace the existing definition with a more precise one. For example:\n     - \"For purposes of this Agreement, 'Confidential Information' shall include only information or material that is clearly marked as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure, or that is disclosed in a manner that a reasonable person would understand to be confidential, and that has actual commercial value or utility in the business of the Disclosing Party.\"\n\n2. **Specify Exclusions:**\n   - Add a list of exclusions to clarify what does not constitute Confidential Information. For example:\n     - \"Confidential Information shall not include information that: (i) is or becomes publicly known through no breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; (ii) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation of confidentiality; (iii) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information.\"\n\n3. **Include Duration of Obligations:**\n   - Add a clause specifying the duration of confidentiality obligations. For example:\n     - \"The obligations of confidentiality shall remain in effect for a period of five (5) years from the date of disclosure of the Confidential Information.\"\n\n4. **Outline Consequences of Unauthorized Disclosure:**\n   - Include a section that outlines the consequences of unauthorized disclosure. For example:\n     - \"In the event of unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall be liable for any damages incurred by the Disclosing Party as a result of such disclosure, including but not limited to any loss of profits or business opportunities.\"\n\n**Rationale:**\nThese changes will help protect your interests by ensuring that only truly confidential information is covered, reducing the risk of disputes over what constitutes confidential information, and providing clear guidelines on the duration of obligations and consequences for breaches. This approach is reasonable and likely to be accepted by the other party, as it clarifies expectations and protects both parties' interests."

      "risk_reason": "The clause contains several potential risks. Firstly, the requirement for the Disclosing Party to label or stamp materials as 'Confidential' may lead to ambiguity if the labeling is not clear or consistent, potentially resulting in disputes over what constitutes Confidential Information. Secondly, the obligation for the Disclosing Party to provide written confirmation of oral communications as Confidential Information may not be timely or adequately fulfilled, leaving the Receiving Party uncertain about their obligations. Additionally, the exclusions from Confidential Information are overly broad, particularly the clause allowing for information learned through 'legitimate means' without clear definitions, which could lead to disputes over what constitutes legitimate means. Furthermore, the clause does not specify the duration of confidentiality obligations, which could leave the Receiving Party exposed to risks if the information is disclosed after a reasonable period. Overall, the clause places significant obligations on the Receiving Party while lacking clarity and protections for both parties.",
      "suggestion": "**Negotiation Suggestion:**\n\n1. **Clarify Labeling Requirements:**\n   - **Proposed Language Change:** Add a requirement for the Disclosing Party to provide a clear definition of what constitutes \"Confidential Information\" and specify the format and location of the labeling. \n   - **Suggested Addition:** \"The Disclosing Party shall provide a written definition of 'Confidential Information' and shall label or stamp all written materials with the word 'Confidential' in a prominent location on the cover page or first page of the document.\"\n\n2. **Timeliness of Oral Communication Confirmation:**\n   - **Proposed Language Change:** Establish a specific timeframe for the Disclosing Party to provide written confirmation of oral communications.\n   - **Suggested Addition:** \"If Confidential Information is transmitted orally, the Disclosing Party shall provide written confirmation within five (5) business days of the oral communication, clearly identifying the information discussed as Confidential.\"\n\n3. **Narrowing Exclusions:**\n   - **Proposed Language Change:** Refine the exclusions to provide more clarity and limit the potential for disputes.\n   - **Suggested Addition:** \"Exclusions from Confidential Information shall not include information that is: (a) publicly known at the time of disclosure or subsequently becomes publicly known through no fault of the Receiving Party; (b) discovered or created by the Receiving Party before disclosure by the Disclosing Party, provided that the Receiving Party can demonstrate such prior knowledge; (c) learned by the Receiving Party through legitimate means other than from the Disclosing Party or Disclosing Party's representatives, where 'legitimate means' shall be defined as information obtained from publicly available sources or third parties without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) disclosed by the Receiving Party with the Disclosing Party's prior written approval.\"\n\n4. **Specify Duration of Confidentiality Obligations:**\n   - **Proposed Language Change:** Include a specific duration for the confidentiality obligations to protect the Receiving Party from indefinite exposure.\n   - **Suggested Addition:** \"The obligations of confidentiality shall remain in effect for a period of three (3) years from the date of disclosure of the Confidential Information, unless otherwise agreed in writing by both parties.\"\n\n**Rationale:**\nThese changes aim to provide clearer definitions and timelines, reducing ambiguity and potential disputes.

The Receiving Party cannot use, share, or publish the confidential information without getting written permission from the Disclosing Party first.",
      "is_risky": true,
      "risk_reason": "The clause contains several potentially problematic elements. Firstly, the term 'strictest confidence' is vague and could lead to differing interpretations regarding the level of confidentiality required. Additionally, the obligation to restrict access to Confidential Information is somewhat ambiguous, as it does not define what constitutes 'reasonably required,' leaving it open to interpretation. The clause imposes one-sided obligations on the Receiving Party, as it requires them to obtain prior written approval from the Disclosing Party for any use or disclosure of the Confidential Information, which could hinder the Receiving Party's ability to operate effectively. Furthermore, the requirement for third parties to sign nondisclosure agreements that are 'at least as protective' as those in this Agreement could create an unreasonable burden, as it does not specify what those protections entail. Overall, the lack of clarity and the one-sided nature of the obligations present significant risks for the Receiving Party.",
      "suggestion": "**Negotiation Suggestion:**\n\nTo address the risks identified in the clause regarding the obligations of the Receiving Party, consider proposing the following specific language changes and additions:\n\n1. **Clarify \"Strictest Confidence\":** Replace \"in strictest confidence\" with \"in a manner consistent with industry standards for confidentiality.\" This provides a clearer benchmark for confidentiality expectations.\n\n   **Proposed Language Change:**\n   \"Receiving Party shall hold and maintain the Confidential Information in a manner consistent with industry standards for confidentiality for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Disclosing Party.\"\n\n2. **Define \"Reasonably Required\":** Add a definition for \"reasonably required\" to provide clarity on access restrictions.

      "is_risky": true,
      "risk_reason": "The clause contains several potential risks. Firstly, the requirement for the Receiving Party to return all materials pertaining to Confidential Information 'immediately' upon request could be problematic, as it does not specify a reasonable timeframe or conditions under which such a request can be made, potentially leading to rushed compliance without adequate consideration. Secondly, the phrase 'any and all records, notes, and other written, printed, or tangible materials' is overly broad and could encompass a wide range of materials, including those that may not be directly related to the Confidential Information, leading to ambiguity about what must be returned. Additionally, the clause places a one-sided obligation on the Receiving Party without corresponding obligations on the Disclosing Party, which could create an imbalance in the contractual relationship.

Suggested language:\n   - \"An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, provided that the individual (i) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; (ii) provides written notice to the Disclosing Party at least [insert reasonable time frame, e.g., 5 business days] prior to any intended disclosure; and (iii) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order or as necessary to comply with legal obligations.\"\n\n3. **Specify Consequences for Non-Compliance:** Include a clause that outlines the consequences for failing to comply with the requirements for disclosure. This will provide clarity and help mitigate potential legal repercussions. Suggested language:\n   - \"Failure to comply with the requirements set forth in this section shall not result in liability for the individual if such failure is due to a good faith belief that disclosure was necessary to protect the individual's rights or comply with legal obligations.\"\n\n4. **Limit Successor Liability:** To address the concern regarding the binding nature of the agreement on successors and assigns, propose a limitation on the scope of this binding effect. Suggested language:\n   - \"This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties and their respective successors and assigns, provided that such successors and assigns are notified of the obligations herein and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.\"\n\nBy incorporating these changes, you can create a more balanced agreement that protects your interests while still being reasonable enough to facilitate acceptance by the other party."
